# searchee v1.0
Scan and Search away<br>
Basically, input a domain - search it with sublist3r or subfinder (if you want to use sublist3r instead change line 13 in the script), then look for any file wthin those subdomains (eg, https://example.com/config.json). Heads up, if you get stuck on a domain it's probably not resolving, so just CTRL+C to skip over it.
